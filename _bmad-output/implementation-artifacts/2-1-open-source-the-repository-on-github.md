# Story 2.1: Open-Source the Repository on GitHub

Status: done

<!-- Note: Validation is optional. Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->

## Story

As the project maintainer,
I want the extension source code publicly available on GitHub under the MIT license with a minimal README,
So that the community can discover, install from source, and begin contributing before the popup feature is built.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A public GitHub repository exists under the MIT license (`LICENSE` file present at project root).
2. `README.md` covers: what the extension does, how to install from the Chrome Web Store (placeholder link until Story 2.2), the full default port map list, and step-by-step instructions to load unpacked for local development.
3. `README.md` includes at least one screenshot or GIF demonstrating labeled localhost tabs in the browser tab bar.
4. The repository is tagged `v0.1.0` and the tag is pushed to remote.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Verify the GitHub repository is set to **Public** (AC: 1)
  - [x] The remote is already configured: `git@github.com:Gancio-xyz/dev-tab-organizer.git`
  - [x] Go to `https://github.com/Gancio-xyz/dev-tab-organizer` → Settings → scroll to "Danger Zone" → confirm visibility is Public (or change it)
  - [x] **Do not create a new remote** — origin is already set correctly
- [x] Create `LICENSE` file at project root (AC: 1)
  - [x] Use standard MIT License text
  - [x] Set year to `2026`
  - [x] Set copyright holder name (your full name or GitHub username)
- [x] Create `README.md` at project root (AC: 2, 3)
  - [x] **Hero headline** — one-line value prop (e.g., "Automatically label your localhost tabs by service name")
  - [x] **What it does** — 2–3 sentences explaining the zero-config tab labeling behavior
  - [x] **Screenshot / GIF** section — at minimum one image showing `⚡ PORT — Title` in the Chrome tab bar (see screenshot guidance below)
  - [x] **Default port map** — table or list of all entries shipped in `port-map.js`
  - [x] **Installation** section — Chrome Web Store install link (placeholder: `[Install from Chrome Web Store](#)`)
  - [x] **Load unpacked (dev)** section — exact steps to load from source
  - [x] **Add a custom port mapping** — brief note directing users to the popup (coming in v1.0)
- [x] Commit `LICENSE` and `README.md` with a meaningful message (AC: 1, 2, 3)
- [x] Push all commits to `origin` (AC: 4)
- [x] Create and push tag `v0.1.0` (AC: 4)
  - [x] `git tag v0.1.0`
  - [x] `git push origin v0.1.0`

## Dev Notes

### Git Remote Already Exists — Do NOT Recreate

The repository remote is already configured:
```
origin  git@github.com:Gancio-xyz/dev-tab-organizer.git
```
Do not run `git remote add origin` — it will fail with "remote already exists". The only required git actions are verifying the repo is public on GitHub, committing the two new files, and tagging.

### `LICENSE` — Exact MIT Text

Create `LICENSE` (no file extension) at the project root with this content, substituting your name and the year:

```

```

### `README.md` — Required Structure and Content

The README must satisfy all AC bullet points. Suggested structure:

```markdown
# Dev Tab Organizer ⚡

> Automatically label your localhost tabs by service name — zero config, instant value.

[screenshot or GIF here]

## What it does

Tired of squinting at 10 identical "localhost" tabs? Dev Tab Organizer rewrites each
localhost tab title to include the port number and service name: `⚡ 3000 — React`,
`⚡ 8080 — Spring Boot`, `⚡ 5173 — Vite`. Works instantly on install — no setup required.

## Install

[Install from Chrome Web Store](#) ← placeholder, updated in Story 2.2

## Default Port Map

| Port | Service |
|------|---------|
| 1234 | Parcel |
| 3000 | React |
| 3001 | Node / API |
| 4000 | Phoenix |
| 4200 | Angular |
| 5000 | Flask |
| 5173 | Vite |
| 8000 | Django |
| 8080 | Spring Boot |
| 8888 | Jupyter |
| 9000 | Webpack |

Don't see your stack? Adding a new entry is one line in `port-map.js`.

## Load unpacked (local development)

1. Clone this repository: `git clone git@github.com:Gancio-xyz/dev-tab-organizer.git`
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`
3. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in the top-right corner)
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the cloned repository folder
5. Open any `localhost:PORT` tab — the title updates immediately

## License

MIT — see [LICENSE](./LICENSE)
```

**What to omit at this stage (comes later):**
- Custom port mapping instructions → popup UI not built until Epic 3; a brief "coming in v1.0" note is fine
- CONTRIBUTING.md link → Epic 4, Story 4.1
- CI/CD badge → Story 4.2

### Screenshot / GIF Guidance (AC: 3)

The AC requires at least one visual. Options in order of effort:

1. **Screenshot (fastest):** With extension loaded, open 2–3 `localhost:PORT` tabs. Take a screenshot of the Chrome tab bar showing `⚡ 3000 — React`, `⚡ 5173 — Vite`, etc. Crop to just the tab bar strip. Save as `assets/screenshot-tab-bar.png` (create `assets/` directory) and reference in README: `![Labeled localhost tabs](./assets/screenshot-tab-bar.png)`.

2. **GIF (more compelling):** Use any screen recorder (QuickTime + GIF conversion, or Kap on macOS) to capture: open `localhost:3000` → tab title changes. 3–5 seconds is enough. Save as `assets/demo.gif`.

**Minimum viable:** A static screenshot is sufficient to ship. The GIF is a nice-to-have for the Web Store listing (Story 2.2).

**Important:** The screenshot REQUIRES Epic 1 to be complete first — you need a working extension to capture real tab labels. If Epic 1 is not yet done, create a placeholder README with a `<!-- TODO: add screenshot -->` comment and add the real image when Epic 1 is complete before tagging.

### Tag `v0.1.0` — Exact Commands

```bash
# Commit the new files first
git add LICENSE README.md assets/
git commit -m "chore: add MIT license, README, and v0.1.0 screenshot"

# Create and push the tag
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin main        # push commits
git push origin v0.1.0      # push tag separately
```

**Note:** Tags are NOT pushed with `git push origin` alone — you must explicitly push the tag with `git push origin v0.1.0` or `git push --tags`.

### Default Port Map — Sync with `port-map.js`

The README port map table MUST exactly match the entries in `port-map.js` as implemented in Story 1.1. Do not list ports in the README that aren't in `port-map.js`, and do not omit entries that are in `port-map.js`. The README is documentation of the actual shipped code — keep them in sync.

### Architecture File List

The project structure defined in the architecture includes `README.md` and `LICENSE` at the root. Creating these files finalizes the intended structure. `CONTRIBUTING.md` is **not** part of this story — it is Story 4.1.

### Dependency — Epic 1 Must Be Complete

This story explicitly gates on "Epic 1 is complete" (per AC). Specifically:
- `background.js`, `port-map.js`, `popup.html`, `popup.js`, `manifest.json`, `icons/` must all exist and work
- The extension must be loadable via "Load unpacked" for the screenshot to be genuine
- Do not skip or fake the screenshot — it is a required AC

If starting this story while Epic 1 stories are still in-progress, create `LICENSE` and the `README.md` shell (without screenshot) first, then add the screenshot asset and finalize the commit + tag only when Epic 1 is `done`.

### Previous Story Context (Stories 1.1–1.4)

- All Epic 1 stories are `ready-for-dev` — implementation is beginning (Story 1.1 is `in-progress`)
- Files that will exist after Epic 1: `manifest.json`, `background.js`, `port-map.js`, `popup.html`, `popup.js`, `icons/`, `tests/`, `.gitignore`
- `README.md` and `LICENSE` are the only new files in this story — no extension code changes

### What Story 2.2 Does (Do Not Overlap)

Story 2.2 handles Chrome Web Store submission. This story (2.1) only covers the GitHub open-sourcing. The Chrome Web Store link in the README is intentionally a placeholder `#` — Story 2.2 updates it with the live URL.
