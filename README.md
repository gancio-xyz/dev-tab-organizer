## What it does

Tired of squinting at 10 identical "localhost" tabs? Dev Tab Organizer rewrites each
localhost tab title to include the port number and service name: `⚡ 3000 — React`,
`⚡ 8080 — Spring Boot`, `⚡ 5173 — Vite`. Works instantly on install — no setup required.

## Install

[Install from Chrome Web Store](#)

## Default Port Map

| Port | Service |
|------|---------|
| 1234 | Parcel |
| 3000 | React |
| 3001 | Node / API |
| 4000 | Phoenix |
| 4200 | Angular |
| 5000 | Flask |
| 5173 | Vite |
| 8000 | Django / FastAPI |
| 8080 | Spring Boot |
| 8888 | Jupyter |
| 9000 | Webpack |

Don't see your stack? Adding a new entry is one line in `port-map.js`.

## Popup — Custom Names & Pause/Resume

Click the extension icon to open the popup:

- **Rename any port** by clicking its input and typing a custom name — saved automatically on blur or Enter
- **Clear a custom name** to revert to the default mapping
- **Pause** the extension temporarily (e.g., during screen recordings) — existing titles are retained
